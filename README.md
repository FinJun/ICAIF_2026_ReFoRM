# ReFoRM project page (ICAIF 2026)

Project page for **From Hindsight to Foresight: Adapting Reusable Reasoning Structures from Recurring Financial Events**.

Published with GitHub Pages from the root of the `main` branch. No build step is needed.

Official implementation: https://github.com/jinsaaang/reform. The BibTeX on the page is the author-provided SSRN citation (abstract 7475378).

## Files

- `index.html`: centered title block with the KakaoBank collaboration credit, overview figure, abstract, recurring financial events, method with the interactive FOMC example, results, reasoning analysis, case studies and citation. Long-form explanations and tables are retained in expandable details; the collaboration credit appears once in the hero.
- `styles.css`: layout, light and dark color schemes, responsive rules, and reduced-motion support.
- `app.js`: the interactive example with pointer, keyboard, and touch relation selection, the results chart and Table 3 model switch, case-study tabs, BibTeX copy, and section highlighting in the header.
- `assets/fig-motivation.svg`, `assets/fig-overview.svg`: Figures 1 and 2 as vector SVG, converted from the authors' figure PDFs and cropped to content.
- `assets/fonts/`: self-hosted Libertinus Serif and Libertinus Sans (SIL Open Font License, see `LICENSE-OFL.txt`).
- `assets/og-image.png`: link preview image.
- `assets/kakaobank-signature-black.png`: collaboration credit.
- `paper.pdf`: supplied manuscript, unchanged.

## Evidence and scope

Benchmark numbers and cases are transcribed or paraphrased from Tables 1, 3, 4, and 5, Figure 3, and Section 5 of the manuscript. The FOMC example is built by hand from public Federal Reserve sources to illustrate path reconstruction and is not a model output. Its selected 2024 evidence predates the target decision, and credit-channel support is marked unverified.

All links to local files are relative, so the page works under a GitHub Pages project path.
